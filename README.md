## Key Contributions

- **Unified World Model + Action Prediction Framework**  
  WorldAgen introduces a Transformer-based architecture that jointly learns **state (world dynamics)** and **action policies**, enabling tighter coupling between environment understanding and decision-making.

- **Test-Time World Model Training (TTT)**  
  WorldAgen performs **lightweight online adaptation at inference time** by collecting state transitions and updating the world model, improving robustness to unseen environments.

- **Improved Generalization via Adaptive World Modeling**  
  By refining its internal world model during deployment, the method significantly enhances performance on challenging benchmarks, surpassing strong baselines with only a small number of test-time updates.
